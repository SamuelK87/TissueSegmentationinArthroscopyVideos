Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is among the preferred procedures for treating a number of
ailments as patients benefit from fast recovery and reduced blood loss. The trade-off is that surgeons lose
direct visual contact with the surgical site and have limited intra-operative imaging techniques for real-time
feedback. Computer vision methods as well as segmentation and tracking of the tissues and tools in the video
frames, are increasingly being adopted to MIS to alleviate such limitations. So far, most of the advances in
MIS have been focused on laparoscopic applications, with scarce literature on knee arthroscopy.It is a  method 
for the automatic segmentation of ACL tissue structures for knee arthroscopy.  

I have used a dataset of 97 labeled images of ACL trained an image segmentation model using DETECTRON2.
